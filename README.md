## Overview

This is an open UI for Hydra, a protocol on Solana for facilitating collective account pooling, fan out wallet and dao treasury. It can be thought of as a group-owned wallet that can accept funds. Unlike a multi-signature wallet, this is meant to collect and distribute funds, not execute group transactions. More information on the protocol can be found a https://github.com/GlassEaters/hydra.
